# Simple Flask App Rock Paper Scissors

#### Purpose
Built very fast, built for fun.

#### Process
Built with Flask. A great example of why JavaScript is suted better for this type of applications. Not only would it simplify the design but also it would run on a client side without making constant requests, and that is a deal breaker.
